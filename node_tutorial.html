<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    There are approximately one hundred million tutorials on the web for
    getting a "Hello, World!" app running with Node.js. This is great! It's
    especially great if your goal is to greet the world and then give up on
    your web career and go spend the rest of your life as, like, a jockey or
    something. That doesn't really describe most of us, so we go looking for
    more tutorials.
</p>

<p>
    In my experience, the "next level" tutorials out there seem about 30
    levels further along. We go from "Hello, World!" to building out an entire
    blogging system with comments. Which is also great, but a lot of times
    those tutorials assume the reader has done a whole bunch of intermediate
    fiddling, and they often drop a bunch of big functions on you all at once.
    I tend to learn best by making lots of smaller, intermediate steps, and I
    don't think I'm the only one.
</p>

<p>
    I'm not the only one, right?
</p>

<p>
    Well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D1cap6yETA" title="GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE!" target="blank">good news, everyone!</a>
    I've done the fiddling and read a bunch of tutorials and shouted at my
    command prompt until things finally worked. I have a web project up and
    running which uses Node.JS, the Express framework, the Jade HTML
    pre-processor, and MongoDB for data. I can read to and write from the DB.
    From there, the sky's the limit.
</p>

<p>
    Here's the deal: I'm going to show you how to get all of this stuff set
    up. I'll be assuming that you're a front-end developer who knows
    HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript well enough that I don't have to explain those. If
    that's you, then this should be a solid primer.
</p>

<p>
    Your app will look pretty, it will connect to a DB, it'll get some
    results, and it'll do stuff with those results. Then for kicks we'll also
    make it save data to the DB. Through it all, I will explain what the code
    does, and how to write it, instead of just giving you massive functions to
    stare at. We'll go from nothing even installed, to a DB-driven web app
    written in a language you fully understand, and the foundation necessary to
    build additional functionality into your app. And we'll do it in about 60
    minutes of installation and coding time. Is that awesome? I submit that it
    is.
</p>

<p>
    Let's go.
</p>

<h3>Part I &ndash; 15 minutes of installing</h3>

<p>
    If you're really starting from scratch, then getting everything up and
    running takes a little bit of time. None of it is difficult. I run Windows
    8 on my main machine, so it'll be slightly different for those on a Mac or
    Ubuntu or other *nix system, but it's principally the same thing in all
    cases.
</p>

<h4>Step 1 &ndash; Install Node.js</h4>

<p>
    This is really easy. Hit the
    <a href="http://nodejs.org" title="Node.js Website" target="_blank">Node.js
    website</a> and click the big green Install button. It'll detect your OS
    and give you the appropriate installer (if for some reason it doesn't,
    click the downloads button and grab the one you need). Run the installer.
    That's it, you have installed Node.js and, equally important, NPM &ndash;
    Node Package Manager &ndash; which lets you add all kinds of great stuff to
    Node quickly and easily.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Open a command prompt</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>cd to the directory in which you wish to keep your test
        apps</strong><br />(for the purposes of this tutorial, C:\node).
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2 &ndash; Install Express</h4>

<p>
    Now that we have Node running, we need the rest of the stuff we're going
    to actually use to create a working website. To do that we're going to
    install Express, which is a framework that takes Node from a barebones
    application and turns it into something that behaves more like the web
    servers we're all used to working with (and actually quite a bit more than
    that). We need to start with Express, because we're going to use its
    scaffolding to get the rest of what we need (more on that in a second). So
    let's type this:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node>npm install -g express
</pre>

<p>
This installs some core Express functionality right into our Node
installation, making it available globally so we can use it anywhere we want.
That's handy. You'll see a bunch of text in your command prompt, mostly a lot
of http 304's and GETs. That's fine. Express is now installed and available.
</p>

<h4>Step 3 &ndash; Create an Express Project</h4>

<p>
We're going to use Express and Jade, but not the Stylus CSS preprocessor
(which people often use in this stack). We're just going to use straight CSS
for right now. We have to use Jade or another templating engine to gain access
to our Node/Express-based data. Jade's not hard to learn if you already know
HTML. Just remember that you really have to pay attention to indentation or
things will go badly wrong.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, still in c:\node or wherever you're storing your node apps, type this:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node>express --sessions nodetest1
</pre>

<p>
Hit enter and watch it go. You'll see something like this:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node>express --sessions nodetest1
    create : nodetest1
    create : nodetest1/package.json
    create : nodetest1/app.js
    create : nodetest1/routes
    create : nodetest1/routes/index.js
    create : nodetest1/routes/user.js
    create : nodetest1/views
    create : nodetest1/views/layout.jade
    create : nodetest1/views/index.jade
    create : nodetest1/public/images
    create : nodetest1/public/javascripts
    create : nodetest1/public
    create : nodetest1/public/stylesheets
    create : nodetest1/public/stylesheets/style.css

    install dependencies:
        $ cd nodetest1 && npm install

    run the app:
        $ node app
</pre>

<h4>Step 4 &ndash; Edit Dependencies</h4>

<p>
    OK, now we have some basic structure in there, but we're not quite done.
    You'll note that the express installation routine created a file called
    package.json in your nodetest1 directory. Open this up in a text editor
    and it'll look like this:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\package.json</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "name": "application-name",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "3.4.4",
        "jade": "*"
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    This is a basic JSON file describing our app and its dependencies. We need
    to add a few things to it. Specifically, calls for MongoDB and Monk. Let's
    make our dependencies object look like this:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
"dependencies": {
    "express": "3.4.4",
    "jade": "*",
    "mongodb": "*",
    "monk": "*"
}
</pre>


<h4>Step 5 &ndash; Install Dependencies</h4>

<p>
Now we've defined our dependencies and we're ready to go. Note that the
asterisks tell NPM "just get the latest version" when you run the install,
which we're about to do.
</p>

<p>
Return to your command prompt, cd to your nodetest1 directory, and type this:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node\nodetest1></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node\nodetest1>npm install
</pre>

<p>
    It's going to print out a ton of stuff. That's because it's reading the
    JSON file we just edited and installing all the stuff listed in the
    dependencies object (yes, including Express &ndash; we installed the top
    level stuff using the &ndash;g flag, but we still have to install some
    necessary code for this particular project). Once NPM has run its course,
    you should have a node_modules directory which contains all of our
    dependencies for this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
    You now have a fully-functioning app ready and waiting to run. Let's test
    it out! <strong>Change to your nodetest1 dir,</strong> and type:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node\nodtest1></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node\nodetest1>node app.js
</pre>

<p>
    Hit enter. You'll get this:
</p>

<h5>Node Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Express server listening on port 3000
</pre>

<p>
    Awesome! Open a browser and head for
    <strong><a href="http://localhost:3000" title="Localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a></strong>
    where you will see a welcome to Express page.
</p>

<p class="browsershot"><img src="browsershot1.png" alt="Welcome to Express Page" /></p>

<p>
    You are now running your own Node JS webserver, with the Express engine and
    Jade HTML preprocessor installed. Not so tough, huh?
</p>

<h3>Part 2 &ndash; OK, Fine, let's do "Hello, World!"</h3>

<p>
    Fire up your favorite text editor or IDE. I like
    <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="Sublime Text Home" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>
    a lot. Point it at your nodetest1 directory and open app.js. This is kind
    of the heart of your, well, app. Not a big surprise there. Here's a
    breakdown of what you're going to see:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var express = require('express');
var routes = require('./routes');
var user = require('./routes/user');
var http = require('http');
var path = require('path');
</pre>

<p>
    This creates a bunch of basic JavaScript variables and ties them to
    certain packages, dependencies, node functionality, and routes. Routes are
    kind of like a combination of models and controllers in this setup &ndash;
    they direct traffic and also contain some programming logic (you can
    establish a more traditional MVC architecture with Express if you like.
    That's outside of the scope of this article). Back when we set up this
    project, Express created all of this stuff for us. We're going to totally
    ignore the user route for now and just work in the top level route
    (controlled by c:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js).
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var app = express();
</pre>

<p>
    This one's important. It instantiates Express and assigns our app variable
    to it. The next section uses this variable to configure a bunch of Express
    stuff.
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// all environments
app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'jade');
app.use(express.favicon());
app.use(express.logger('dev'));
app.use(express.bodyParser());
app.use(express.methodOverride());
app.use(app.router);
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
</pre>

<p>
    This sets the port, tells the app were to find its views, what engine to
    use to render those views (Jade), and calls a few methods to get things up
    and running. Note also that the final line is telling Express to serve
    static objects from the /public/ dir, but to make them actually seem like
    they're coming from the top level. For example, the images directory is
    c:\node\nodetest1\public\images &hellip; but it is accessed at
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/images" title="Localhost Images directory" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/images</a>
</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> you will need to change this line:

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    app.use(express.bodyParser());
</pre>

<p>
    to:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    app.use(express.urlencoded());
</pre>

<p>
    In order to avoid some warnings in your Node console when you run your
    app. This is due to some upcoming changes in Express and its plugins. If
    you don't make this change, your app will still run, but you'll see text
    about upcoming deprications every time you run it.
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// development only
if ('development' == app.get('env')) {
  app.use(express.errorHandler());
}
</pre>

<p>
    This lets you do some error-checking during development. It's important
    but for the purposes of this tutorial we're not going to do anything with
    it.
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.get('/', routes.index);
app.get('/users', user.list);
</pre>

<p>
    This is telling the app which routes to use when a particular URI is hit.
    Note that the "user" variable was declared above, and is mapped to
    /routes/user.js &ndash; we're calling the list function defined in that
    file. Or we would be if we were visiting the users page, but we're
    ignoring it, remember?
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
  console.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port'));
});
</pre>

<p>
    Last but not least, this creates our http server and launches it. Good
    times!
</p>

<p>
    Now then, let's make stuff. We're not going to just stick "Hello, World!"
    on our index page. Instead we're going to use this as an opportunity to
    learn a bit more about routes and to take a look at how Jade works for
    putting pages together. First, let's add a line to handle a new URI. At the
    bottom of the app.get() section of app.js, add this line:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    app.get('/helloworld', routes.helloworld);
</pre>

<p>
    If you were to hit ctrl-c to kill app.js in your command prompt, then
    restart it, and then go to
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/helloworld" title="Hello World on Localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/helloworld</a>
    you would get a very exciting node error and a crash back to the command
    prompt. That's because we haven't modified our route yet to handle that
    request. Let's do that! In your text editor, open up your routes folder,
    find index.js, and open it. It will look like this:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
/*
 * GET home page.
 */

exports.index = function(req, res){
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
};
</pre>

<p>
    Pretty sparse, right? Let's add that new page. My preferred approach is to
    add a new route file per top-level directory, but we're not creating a
    whole new helloworld directory under /views, so we're just using the index
    route. At the bottom of the file, add this code:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
exports.helloworld = function(req, res){
  res.render('helloworld', { title: 'Hello, World!' });
};
</pre>

<p>
    That's all it takes to handle routing the URI, but we don't have any
    actual page for res.render to &hellip; render. That's where Jade comes in.
    Open up your views folder, and then go ahead and open index.jade. Before
    you do anything else, <strong>save it as helloworld.jade</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Now take a look at the code:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\views\helloworld.jade</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
extends layout

block content
    h1= title
    p Welcome to #{title}
</pre>

<p>
    This is pretty straightforward. It uses ("extends") the file layout.jade
    as a template, and then within the content block defined in the layout
    file, it sticks a header and a paragraph. Note the use of the "title"
    variable which we set above, in our index.js route. This means we don't
    even have to change the text at all in order for it to show different
    stuff from the home page. But let's change it anyway to:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
p Hello, World! Welcome to #{title}
</pre>

<p>
    Save the file, go to your command prompt, ctrl-c to kill app.js if it's
    already running, and then type:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node\nodetest1></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
node app.js
</pre>

<p>
    In order to restart the server. By the way, this seems a good time to
    mention: changes to Jade templates do not require a server restart, but
    basically whenever you change a js file, such as app.js or the route
    files, you'll need to restart to see changes.
</p>

<p>
    SO &hellip; with the server restarted, navigate to
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/helloworld" title="Hello World on Localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/helloworld</a>
    and enjoy the completely asinine text that gets displayed:
</p>

<p class="browsershot"><img src="browsershot2.png" alt="Hello World Page" /></p>

<p>
OK! So now we've got our router routing us to our view, which we are viewing.
Let's do some modeling. I'll give you a moment if you need to fix your hair or
makeup.
</p>

<h3>Part 3 &ndash; Create our DB and read stuff from it</h3>

<h4>Step 1 &ndash; Install MongoDB</h4>

<p>
    We're leaving our text editor for a bit and going back to our command
    prompt. Well, first we're going to our web browser, pointing it to
    <a href="http://mongodb.org" title="MongoDB Home" target="_blank">http://mongodb.org/</a>
    and downloading Mongo. Click the downloads link in the main menu and snag
    the production release that fits your system. For Windows 8 on a 64-bit
    processor, we want "64-bit *2008R2+". This will give you a zip file, which
    you should unzip to a temp directory. Then you should make a directory
    where you want to forever after store Mongo. You could use c:\mongo or
    c:\program files\mongo or any other crazy thing you want. It doesn't really
    matter &ndash; Mongo itself is quite small, and we'll be storing our
    database in our nodetest1 directory.
</p>

<p>
    Anyway, copy the files in the bin folder within your temp directory to
    wherever you want Mongo to live, and you're done. You've installed Mongo. Now
    let's make it do stuff.
</p>

<h4>Step 2 &ndash; Run mongod and mongo</h4>

<p>
    In your nodetest1 directory, create a subdir called "data". Then navigate
    to the directory in which you placed your MongoDB files (let's say
    C:\mongodb for now). From that directory, type the following:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\mongo\</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
mongod --dbpath c:\node\nodetest1\data
</pre>

<p>
    You'll see the Mongo server start up. This is going to take a while if it's
    the first time, because it has to do some preallocating of space and a few
    other housekeeping tasks. Once it says "[initandlisten] waiting for
    connections on port 27017", you're good. There's nothing more to do here;
    the server is running. Now you need to <strong>open a second command
    prompt.</strong> Navigate again to your Mongo installation directory, and
    type:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\mongo\</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
mongo
</pre>

<p>
    You'll see something like the following:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
c:\mongo>mongo
MongoDB shell version: 2.4.5
connecting to: test
</pre>

<p>
    Additionally, if you're paying attention to your mongod instance, you'll
    see it mention that a connection has been established. All right, you've
    got MongoDB up and running, and you've connected to it with the client.
    We'll use this client to manually work on our database, for a bit, but it's
    not necessary for running the website. Only the server daemon (mongod) is
    needed for that.
</p>

<h4>Step 3 &ndash; Create a Database</h4>

<p>

    Don't worry about "connecting to: test" &hellip; that's just the default
    database Mongo decides to use if you don't specify one on the command
    line, which we didn't because it's not important right now. It doesn't
    actually even create the "test" database unless you add a record. It'd
    be totally fine to just work in that database for right now, but let's
    make one of our own. In your Mongo console, type the following:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
use nodetest1
</pre>

<p>
    Now we're using the database "nodetest1." Like with "test", nothing
    actually exists yet. To make the database exist, we have to add some
    data. We're going to start off by doing that right inside of the Mongo
    client.
</p>

<h4>Step 4 &ndash; Add some Data</h4>

<p>
    My favorite thing about MongoDB is that it uses JSON for its structure,
    which means it was instantly familiar for me. If you're not familiar with
    JSON, you'll need to do some reading, as I'm afraid that's outside the
    scope of this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
    Let's add a record to our collection. For the purposes of this tutorial,
    we're just going to have a simple database of usernames and email
    addresses. Our data format will thus look like this:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "_id" : 1234,
    "username" : "cwbuecheler",
    "email" : "cwbuecheler@nospam.com"
}
</pre>

<p>
    You can create your own _id assignment if you really want, but I find it's
    best to let Mongo just do its thing. It will provide a unique identifier
    for every single top-level collection entry. Let's add one and see how it
    works. In your Mongo client, type this:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
db.usercollection.insert({ "username" : "testuser1", "email" : "testuser1@testdomain.com" })
</pre>

<p>
    Something important to note here: that "db" stands for our database, which
    as mentioned above we've defined as "nodetest1". The "usercollection" part
    is our collection. Note that there wasn't a step where we created the
    "usercollection" collection. That's because the first time we add to it,
    it's going to be auto-created. Handy. OK, Hit enter. Assuming everything
    went right, you should see &hellip; nothing. That's not very exciting, so
    type this:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    db.usercollection.find().pretty()
</pre>

<p>
    In case you're curious, the .pretty() method gives us linebreaks. It will return:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5202b481d2184d390cbf6eca"),
    "username" : "testuser1",
    "email" : "testuser1@testdomain.com"
}
</pre>

<p>
    Except, of course, your ObjectID will be different, since as mentioned,
    Mongo is automatically generating those. That's all there is to writing
    to MongoDB from the client app, and if you've ever worked with JSON
    services before, you are probably going "oh, wow, that's going to be easy
    to implement on the web." &hellip; you're right!
</p>

<p>
    A quick note on DB structure: obviously in the long run you're unlikely
    to be storing everything at the top level. There are a ton of resources
    on the internet for schema design in MongoDB. Google is your friend!
</p>

<p>
    Now that we've got one record, let's add a a couple more. In your Mongo
    console, type the following:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
newstuff = [{ "username" : "testuser2", "email" : "testuser2@testdomain.com" }, { "username" : "testuser3", "email" : "testuser3@testdomain.com" }]
db.usercollection.insert(newstuff);
</pre>

<p>
    Note that, yes, we can pass an array with multiple objects to our
    collection. Handy! Another use of db.usercollection.find().pretty() will
    show all three records:
</p>

<h5>Mongo Console</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5202b481d2184d390cbf6eca"),
        "username" : "testuser1",
        "email" : "testuser1@testdomain.com"
}
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5202b49ad2184d390cbf6ecb"),
        "username" : "testuser2",
        "email" : "testuser2@testdomain.com"
}
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5202b49ad2184d390cbf6ecc"),
        "username" : "testuser3",
        "email" : "testuser3@testdomain.com"
}
</pre>

<p>
    Now we're going to start actually interacting with the web server and site
    that we set up earlier.
</p>

<h4>Step 5 &ndash; Hook Mongo up to Node</h4>

<p>
    This is where the rubber meets the road. Let's start by building a page
    that just spits out our DB entries in a mildly pretty form. Here's the
    HTML we're shooting to generate:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:testuser1@testdomain.com"&gt;testuser1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:testuser2@testdomain.com"&gt;testuser2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:testuser3@testdomain.com"&gt;testuser3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    I know this isn't rocket science, but that's the point. We're just doing
    a simple DB read-and-write in this tutorial, not trying to build a whole
    website. First things first, we need to add a few lines to our main
    app.js file &ndash; the heart and soul of our app &ndash; in order to
    actually connect to our MongoDB instance. Open C:\node\nodetest1\app.js and
    at the top you'll see:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var express = require('express');
var routes = require('./routes');
var user = require('./routes/user');
var http = require('http');
var path = require('path');
</pre>

<p>
    Now add these three lines:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var express = require('express');
var routes = require('./routes');
var user = require('./routes/user');
var http = require('http');
var path = require('path');

// New Code
var mongo = require('mongodb');
var monk = require('monk');
var db = monk('localhost:27017/nodetest1');
</pre>

<p>
    These lines tell our app we want to talk to MongoDB, we're going to use
    Monk to do it, and our database is located at localhost:27017/nodetest1.
    Note that 27017 is the default port your MongoDB instance should be
    running on. If for some reason you've changed it, obviously use that port
    instead. Now look at the bottom of the file, where you have this:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.get('/', routes.index);
app.get('/users', user.list);
app.get('/helloworld', routes.helloworld);
</pre>

<p>
    Add the following line at the bottom:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.get('/userlist', routes.userlist(db));
</pre>

<p>
    This line says that when a user navigates to /userlist, we should pass
    the "db" variable (our database object) to the userlist route. But we
    don't HAVE a userlist route yet, so it's time to create one.
</p>

<h4>Step 6 &ndash; Pull your data from Mongo and display it</h4>

<p>
    Open up C:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js in your editor. It's still got
    the index route, and the goofy /helloworld route. Let's add a third:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
exports.userlist = function(db) {
    return function(req, res) {
        var collection = db.get('usercollection');
        collection.find({},{},function(e,docs){
            res.render('userlist', {
                "userlist" : docs
            });
        });
    };
};
</pre>

<p>
    OK &hellip; that's getting fairly complicated. All it's really doing,
    though, is running a wrapper function to which we pass our db variable,
    and then doing a page render just like the other two "exports" in this
    route file. We then tell it which collection we want to use
    ('usercollection') and do a find, then return the results as the variable
    "docs". Once we have those documents, we then do a render of userlist
    (which will need a corresponding Jade template), giving it the userlist
    variable to work with, and passing our database documents to that
    variable.
</p>

<p>
    Next let's set up our Jade template. Navigate to C:\node\nodetest1\views\
    and open index.jade. Once again, <strong>immediately save it as
    userlist.jade</strong>. Then edit the HTML so it looks like this:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\view\userlist.jade</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
extends layout

block content
    h1.
        User List
    ul
        each user, i in userlist
            li
                a(href="mailto:#{user.email}")= user.username
</pre>

<p>
    This is saying that we're going to pull in the set of documents we just
    called userlist over in the route file, and then for each entry (named
    'user' during the loop), get the email and username values from the object
    and put them into our html. We've also got the count &ndash; i &ndash;
    handy in case we need it, though in this instance we don't.
</p>


<p>
    We're all set. Save that file, and let's restart our node server. Remember
    how to do that? Go to your command prompt, head for C:\node\nodetest1\ and
    ctrl-c to kill app.js if it's still running from way back before. Then
    type:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node\nodetest1\</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node\nodetest1>node app.js
</pre>

<p>
Now open your browser and head to
<a href="http://localhost:3000/userlist" title="Localhost DB Output Page" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/userlist</a>
and marvel in the results.
</p>

<p class="browsershot"><img src="browsershot3.png" alt="DB Ouput Page - Default Data" /></p>


<p>
You're now pulling data from the DB and spitting it out onto a web page. Nice!
</p>

<p>
    There one more thing I badly wanted to cover in this tutorial, but because
    it's already about as long as the Bible, I'm going to breeze through it
    here. You could very easily change your userlist view from an
    Express-driven web page complete with Jade template to a plain old JSON
    response. You could then access this with AJAX and manipulate it on the
    client-side, with jQuery for example, instead of on the server side. I
    won't object if that's the way you want to go, but I can't cover it here,
    so I'll just point you to
    <a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#res.json" title="res.json at Express Documentation" target="_blank">res.json</a>
    and say "go for it, it's not too hard."
</p>

<p>
    Let's finish this up.
</p>


<h3>Part 4 &ndash; The holy grail: writing to the DB</h3>

<p>
    Writing to the database is not particularly difficult. Essentially we need
    to set up a route that takes a POST, rather than a GET. We could use
    AJAX here, and honestly that's my preference most of the time &hellip; but
    that's really a whole different tutorial, so we'll stick to a standard
    post-and-show-results approach. Once again, though, it's not too hard to
    adapt things to work that way if you want.
</p>

<h4>Step 1 &ndash; Create your data input</h4>

<p>
    We're going quick and dirty here: two ugly, unstyled text inputs and a
    submit button. 1996-style. Just like before, we'll start with app.get();
    and then give it something to get. Open up app.js and find the part with
    all of those app.get() calls, and add this to the bottom of them:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.get('/newuser', routes.newuser);
</pre>

<p>
    So that you get:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.get('/', routes.index);
app.get('/users', user.list);
app.get('/helloworld', routes.helloworld);
app.get('/userlist', routes.userlist(db));

// New Code
app.get('/newuser', routes.newuser);
</pre>

<p>
    As with all app.get requests, we need to adjust the route to know what to
    serve up. Open up /routes/index.js and add the following:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
exports.newuser = function(req, res){
  res.render('newuser', { title: 'Add New User' });
};
</pre>

<p>
    Now we just need a template. Open up /views/index.jade, save it as
    newuser.jade, and replace the whole file contents with this:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\views\newuser.jade</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
extends layout

block content
    h1= title
    form#formAddUser(name="adduser",method="post",action="/adduser")
        input#inputUserName(type="text", placeholder="username", name="username")
        input#inputUserEmail(type="text", placeholder="useremail", name="useremail")
        button#btnSubmit(type="submit") submit
</pre>

<p>
    Here we're creating a form with the ID "formAddUser" (I like to preface
    my IDs with the type of thing we're ID'ing. It's a personal quirk). Method
    is post, action is adduser. Pretty straightforward. Under that we've
    defined our two inputs and our button.
</p>

<p>
    If you restart your node server and go to
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/newuser" title="Localhost DB Input Page" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/newuser</a>
    you'll see your form in all its glory.
</p>

<p class="browsershot"><img src="browsershot4.png" alt="Welcome to Express Page" /></p>

<p>
    Go ahead and submit. Enjoy the "can't post to /adduser" error. We're about
    to fix that.
</p>

<h4>Step 2 &ndash; Create your DB functions</h4>

<p>
    OK, same process as before. First we edit app.js, then our route file, and
    then our Jade template. Except there's no Jade template here because we're
    posting and then forwarding. See below. It'll all make sense! Let's start:
    Open app.js and once again find your stack of app.get calls:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.get('/', routes.index);
app.get('/users', user.list);
app.get('/helloworld', routes.helloworld);
app.get('/userlist', routes.userlist(db));
app.get('/newuser', routes.newuser);
</pre>

<p>
    Now add the following at the bottom of the list:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\app.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.post('/adduser', routes.adduser(db));
</pre>

<p>
    Note that that's an app.post, not an app.get. If you want to separate
    it from the app.gets with a comment or newline, I won't stop you. Let's
    set up our route.
</p>

<p>
    Go back to /routes/index.js and let's create our insertion function. This
    is a big one, so I've commented the code pretty thoroughly. Here it is:
</p>

<h5>C:\node\nodetest1\routes\index.js</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
exports.adduser = function(db) {
    return function(req, res) {

        // Get our form values. These rely on the "name" attributes
        var userName = req.body.username;
        var userEmail = req.body.useremail;

        // Set our collection
        var collection = db.get('usercollection');

        // Submit to the DB
        collection.insert({
            "username" : userName,
            "email" : userEmail
        }, function (err, doc) {
            if (err) {
                // If it failed, return error
                res.send("There was a problem adding the information to the database.");
            }
            else {
                // If it worked, forward to success page
                res.redirect("userlist");
                // And set the header so the address bar doesn't still say /adduser
                res.location("userlist");
            }
        });

    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Obviously in the real world you would want a <em>ton</em> more validating,
    error-checking, and the like. You'd want to check for duplicate usernames
    and emails, for example. And to vet that the email address at least looks
    like a legit entry. But this'll work for now. As you can see, on
    successfully adding to the DB, we forward the user back to the userlist
    page, where they should see their newly added user.
</p>

<p>
    Are there smoother ways to do this? Absolutely. We're staying as
    bare-bones as possible here. Now, let's go add some data!
</p>

<h4>Step 4 &ndash; Connect and add data to your DB</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Make sure mongod is running!</strong> Then head to your command
    prompt, kill your node server if it's still running, and restart it:
</p>

<h5>Command C:\node\nodetest1></h5>
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\node\nodetest1>node app.js
</pre>

<p>
    Assuming your server is running, which it should be, return to your web
    browser and point it at
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/newuser" title="Localhost DB Input Page" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/newuser</a>
    again. There's our exciting form, just like before. Except now let's fill
    in some values before we hit submit. I went with username "noderocks" and
    email "noderocks@rockingnode.com" ... you can go with whatever you'd like.
</p>

<p class="browsershot"><img src="browsershot5.png" alt="Welcome to Express Page" /></p>

<p>
    Click submit, and check it out ... we're back at /userlist and there's
    our new entry!
</p>

<p class="browsershot"><img src="browsershot6.png" alt="Welcome to Express Page" /></p>

<p>
    We are officially reading and writing from a MongoDB database using
    Node.js, Express, and Jade. You are now what the kids call a "full stack"
    developer (probably not a GOOD one, just yet, but I didn't promise that).
</p>

<p>
    Congratulations. Seriously. If you followed this all the way through,
    and if you really paid attention to what you were doing and didn't just
    paste code, you should have a really solid grasp on routes and views,
    reading from the DB, and posting to the DB. That is <strong>all you
    need</strong> to get started developing whatever app you want to build.
    I don't know about you, but I think that's really cool.
</p>

<h3>Part 5 &ndash; Next steps</h3>

<p>
    From here, there's a million different directions you could go. You could
    check out
    <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" title="Mongoose JS Home" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>,
    which is another Mongo-manipulation package for Node/Express. It's bigger
    than Monk, but it also does more. You could check out Stylus, the CSS
    preprocessor that comes with Express. You could google "Node Express
    Mongo Tutorial" and see what comes up. Just keep exploring and keep
    building!
</p>

<p>
    I hope this tutorial's been helpful. I wrote it because I could've used
    it when I got started, and I couldn't seem to find something that was
    quite at this level, or that broke things down in such long, long,
    <em>loooong</em> detail. If you made it this far, thanks for sticking
    with it!
